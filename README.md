### Week 0

In this week, I revised the Python basics and studied about Git and GitHub.

### Week 1

In this week, I did a crash course on Machine Learning by Google and learned the basics of Machine Learning.

### Week 2

In this week, I did a course on TensorFlow from Udacity and learned how to use TensorFlow for Deep Learning.
I also did a tutorial to understand the Resnet architecture. Then I did a YouTube series on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). There, I theoretically
understood the structure and functions of GANs.

### Week 3

In this week, I did a tutorial to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch in Google Colab. Currently, I am doing the Coursera course on 
Sequence Models under Deep Learning Specialisation to understand Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
